Originally created as part of an introduction to OOP, this text adventure is a throwback to the days before graphics were ever a question. It has since become somewhat of an orphaned child. I've recently decided to come back and work on it some more to see what kind of progress I've made.

Still in pre-alpha. This program isn't ready to do ANYTHINNG.
