10/8/15 Yesterday's issue resolved. - Didymus
10/7/15 There was problem with "pushing" our project. I deleted the repository and re-initialized it then added all of the proper collaborators. I'm able to pull and commit, and the project is supposedly pushing to the right address but for some reason I consistently get the error "index-pack abnormal exit" when I try to push to the repository. -Didymus
